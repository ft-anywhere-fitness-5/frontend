# Pitch
These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing.

While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.

Instructors can take attendance, request and process payments, create virtual “punch passes” for each type of class offered, alert clients of cancellations or location changes and so much more. Clients can easily find out information on classes - location, class size, start time and duration, as well as reschedule or cancel an upcoming appointment or reservation right from the mobile app.

## How To
on landing, you will see the current class list

above that is a search bar where you can search for classes by name. OR, you can click a category to search by.

The Top right has links to different pages. 
- `login` to sign in if you have already signed up
- `signup` to register as either a client or class instructor
- `home` will bring you to your homepage if already logged in.
- `logout` will of course log you out if logged in at the time.


## Cient

if signed in as a client, the homepage shows a list of your current reserved classes.
you will also notice a tab to the right marked, 'open'
this opens another navigation tool that will redirect back to all the classes.
classes will now show a reserve button which wiil add that class to you reserve list.

## Instructor

Here, the open tab inlcudes an add-class link. From there the instructor can add new classes. Classes also show an edit and delete button.
